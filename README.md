#  A Tool to search Hacker News for a specific term

You can use the Hacker News Search API and a programming language such as Python to build a script that searches Hacker News for a specific term and displays the results in a tabular format.

Here is an example of how you could use the Hacker News Search API and Python to build a script that searches for a specific term and displays the results in a tabular format:

```
import requests

# Set the search term and API endpoint
search_term = "docker"
api_endpoint = f"https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query={search_term}"

# Send the request to the API endpoint
response = requests.get(api_endpoint)

# Check the status code of the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    # If the request is successful, get the data from the response
    data = response.json()
    # Extract the relevant data from the response
    results = data["hits"]
    # Print the results in a tabular format
    print("Title | URL | Points | Author | Date")
    for result in results:
        print(f"{result['title']} | {result['url']} | {result['points']} | {result['author']} | {result['created_at']}")
else:
    # If the request is not successful, print an error message
    print("An error occurred while fetching the data from Hacker News")
```

This script sends a request to the Hacker News Search API using the requests library in Python, and displays the results in a tabular format with the title, URL, points, author, and date of each result.

You can modify this script to customize the search term, add additional columns to the table, or perform other tasks as needed.
